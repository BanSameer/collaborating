## A Recipe
 Everyone likes their eggs differently, and that's ok! I, along with many others, prefer my yolks runny—which is why I usually go the sunny-side-up or over-easy route. In both, the whites are set and the yolks are runny. The difference is that over-easy eggs are flipped before removing from the pan, while sunny-side-up eggs only cook on one side. Eggs over-medium and over-hard just require longer cook time on their flipped side so the yolk is semi or completely cooked, respectively.
